 
### Animations  
There are two approaches to creating animations:  either with CSS in the View/Presentation layer, or via Javascript in the Controller/Application layer.  

Using CSS3 transforms will allow you to run things on the GPU, and is generally the easiest way to get flicker-free animations.  But be careful!  Be sure to audit your CSS files!  

However, with Javascript and SVG, you can build beautiful data-driven animations using D3.js.  But they are very tricky and fickle to create.

### Animations in the View/Presentation Layer
