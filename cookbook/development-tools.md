## Development Tools

You're going to need to set up a development environment if you want to program in Meteor.  There's a growing ecosystem of tools to use, so the focus in this document is on tools that are known to work together well.   

===============================================================
#### Integrated Development Environments

Well, you're going to need to select an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), configure it so it works with Meteor, and set up debugging and profiling utilities.  See below.  

[Atom](http://www.atom.io) - The javascript IDE that fully leverages Meteor's isomorphic javascript framework.  Recommended.  
[WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - The most full featured IDE currently available for Meteor.    
[Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) -For something more light-weight and quick, try Sublime.   
[Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/) - The original Cloud Development for Meteor. 
[Cloud9](https://c9.io/)  - The newest Cloud Development offering that supports Meteor.

[MongoHub](http://mongohub.todayclose.com/) - Another Mongo GUI, similar to RoboMongo.
